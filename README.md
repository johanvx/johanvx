# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the R-word programming language and [Typst].
- ðŸ”¤ I speak Chinese (Mandarin, Cantonese and Hakkanese), English and French.
- ðŸ‘‚ _Johan_ is a French name and can be pronounced as /Ê’É”É‘Ìƒ/ or /Ê’É”an/. It's fine to pronounce it the same as _John_ in English.
